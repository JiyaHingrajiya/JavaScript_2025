//word vs keyword
//variables and constants

    //let var and const 

    //var value assigned can be changed and re-declared
    //let value assigned can be changed but not re-declared
    //const value assigned cannot be changed and re-declared

//hoisting
//variables and functions are hoisted which means their declaration is moved to the top of the code
//variables are hoisted but not their values
//functions are hoisted with their values

//example 
// console.log(a); //undefined (here it takes declaration on the top of the code)
// var a = 12;

// console.log(b); //error ( as it not declared )


//premetive and reference data types

//premetive = string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol
//reference = object, array, function  [], (), {}


//conditional statments
//if else, switch case, ternary operator


//loops
//for, while, do while, for in, for of

//functions
function print(){
    console.log("Hello world");
}

print();

//array
var arr =[1,2,3,4,4];
arr.pop();
arr.push(5);
arr.unshift(0); // to add at the start
arr.shift(); // to remove at the start
arr.splice(2,1); // to remove at a specific index and after , is the no of values to be reomved

//objects
